\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}
In this paper, we address the problem of spatial information highlighting using implicit feedback. We formulate our problem in form of a constrained optimization problem and propose \sgg, a novel polygon-based feedback capturing approach which returns few highlights in line with analyst's implicit preferences. \sgg\ derives the implicit feedback by finding interesting dense regions (IDRs) from mouse movements of the analyst over the geographical map.

We consider a few directions of improvement for this work. We are interested to incorporate an ``explainability'' component into \sgg\ which can describe causalities behind preferences. For instance, we are interested to find seasonal patterns to see why the preferences of analysts change from place to place during various seasons of the year. Another direction is to incorporate ``Query by Visualization'' approaches into \sgg\ where analysts can specify their intents alongside their implicit preferences, directly on the map \cite{siddiqui2016effortless}.
