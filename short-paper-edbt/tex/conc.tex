\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}
We addressed the problem of generic guidance and introduced \framework, the first efficient interactive highlighting approach in spatiotemporal data. We formulated our problem in form of a constrained optimization and proposed {\sc Highlighter}, a greedy algorithm to highlight $k$-best points for a given point of interest within a time limit. We discussed genericness of our approach by materializing few examples from restaurant and taxi datasets. We also showed the efficiency and usability of our framework in form of performance experiments and user study. There are several directions of improvement for this work. Specifically, we want to consider an analyst profile vector which is built during interactive steps and will be exploited to return more analyst-tailored results.
